# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Fake news has become a critical challenge in today’s digital ecosystem, spreading rapidly across social media and online news platforms. Traditional fake news detection systems rely mainly on shallow textual analysis and fail to capture contextual, multimodal, and source-level information.

This project proposes a Context-Aware Transformer Framework that performs multi-level fake news detection by analyzing content, context, and source credibility. The framework integrates transformer-based language models with multimodal feature fusion and explainable AI techniques to deliver accurate and interpretable predictions.
